2. Users can view and interact with a choropleth map and bar chart to learn about beer production across America between 2008 and 2019.

3. Users can learn and view beer selections, breweries, ratings, and reviews based off of key descriptors (example):
- Taste: Bitter, Sweet, Sour, Salty
- Flavor And Aroma: Fruits, Hoppy, Spices, Malty

4. Users can save beer selections

5. Users can use search feature to learn more via Wikipedia API

TBD:
- Users can add their own reviews and ratings to current selections
- Users can add new beer selections and ratings based off key descriptors
- Users can update their profile
- Users can view and interact with scatter map to visualize breweries across America
