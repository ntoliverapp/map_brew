<h1 class="text-center">map_brew</h1>
<p> map_brew is an opportunity to learn more about breweries and beer across the US. There are 879 unique beers, 183 breweries, and 100 styles to enjoy. </p> 
<p>Beer is the fermented, alcoholic product of the careful combination of water, malt, hops, and yeast. That’s it. Okay, so hops weren’t always included in the mix, but we’ll get to that later. Where the modern beer industry is concerned, whatever six pack you pick up from your local refrigerated case, the malt-hops-yeast trifecta will be the secret of its glory. Of course, this being the modern beer industry, there’s also a chance someone got a little inspired and brewed apricots into it, or maybe the beer was “hopped” for an extra-long period of time—resulting in a more assertively bitter flavor. But the basic backbone of your beer, from Coors to craft, remains deliciously the same.</p>

        <h1>Mouthfeel</h1>
        <p>Mouthfeel can be defined as the textural attributes of beer, those which produce a tactile sensation in the mouth. The sensations associated with mouthfeel are physical qualities of beer and should be considered a major attribute when evaluating beer, along with aroma and flavor. There are three key attributes recognized in the perception of mouthfeel: Astringency,Taste, and Flavor Aroma</p>

        <h5>Astringency</h5>
        <p>Astringency is often listed as a “taste” but is as much a physical sensation of beer as it is a flavor. Although not particularly hard to define, it is often confused with bitterness and is easily misdiagnosed in tasting profiles. While some balanced astringency can be pleasant in certain beer styles, notable astringency is generally considered to be a flavor fault in beer.</p>

      <h5>Body</h5>
      <p>Body is the sensation of palate fullness, the viscosity and feel of beer in the mouth. It is a characteristic of beer that reflects its ending density and refers to the mouth-filling and thickness properties that a given sample contains.</p>

      <h1>Taste</h1>
      <p>If you’ve never tasted beer, you may understandably be wondering what it tastes like. The reality is that there are several flavor profiles when it comes to beer. What does beer taste like? Generally speaking, beer can be sweet, sour, bitter, or even salty depending on the ingredients, storage process (is the beer fresh, canned, or bottled?), age, and manufacturer. As you can see, there is no set taste.</p>

    <div class="carousel-caption d-none d-md-block">
    <h5>Bitterness</h5>
    <p>Whether very strong or barely perceptible, bitterness is critically important to beer flavor. The alpha acids are the main source of bitterness from hops. Iso-alpha acids, produced from the alpha acids during the wort boil, are the main source of bitterness in beer. The bitterness in beer is measured by the International Bitterness Unit (IBU). Bitterness is often confused with the physical sensations of burning and astringency or dryness. https://beerandbrewing.com/dictionary/z8NACbisww/</p>

    <div class="carousel-caption d-none d-md-block">
    <h5>Sweet</h5>
    <p>Residual Sugars are sugars that are still present in beer after the fermentation process is complete. A beer with a lot of residual sugar will have a fuller body and often taste sweeter, whereas one with less residual sugar will be drier and have a lighter mouthfeel. The sugars present in beer are generally derived from fruits and malted barley. Sometimes brewers will use adjuncts, different malted grains, corn, rice, syrup, honey, molasses, or other forms of sugar, in varying quantities, to complement the sugars extracted from the barley. The majority of these sugars are then consumed by yeast during the fermentation process. https://beerandbrewing.com/dictionary/0veIbvxxWL/</p>

    <h5>Sour</h5>
    <p>Sourness describes the taste that perceives acidity. See acidity. The mechanism for detecting sour taste is similar to that which detects salt taste. Hydrogen ion channels detect the concentration of hydronium ions that are formed from acids and water. Sour taste is mainly recognized on the left and right sides of the tongue.  https://beerandbrewing.com/dictionary/rMs1ZNevg5</p>

    <div class="carousel-caption d-none d-md-block">
    <h5> Salty</h5>
    <p>Sodium Chloride, commonly known as table salt or sea salt, contribute immensely to flavor and taste perception in final beer. Sodium ions are generally considered the less desirable of the two. Sodium ions give the familiar “salty” notes and a coarseness and harshness that most brewers try to avoid. Chloride, however, can give a softness and smoothness, almost sweetness, to beer flavor, in direct counterpoint to the commonly found sulfate ion that contributes a dry sharpness and accentuates bitterness.

      <h1>Flavor and Aroma</h1>
      <p>The interplay of flavor and aroma significantly affects how our brains perceive flavor. The common perception is that our tongue is the main facilitator of all things culinary, but your taste buds aren’t capable of delivering the whole story alone. It’s only when we take the time to breathe in the aroma that we can fully tap into the flavor. Fruits, hops, spices, and malts play a key role in this.</p>

    <div class="carousel-caption d-none d-md-block">
    <h5> Fruits</h5>
    <p>Fruity, having the flavor, aroma, or character of fruit. When used in association with beer, fruity is usually a synonym for estery. See esters. During fermentation, especially warm fermentation, yeast will synthesize esters, organic compounds with aromatics that we often associate with fruit. These include ethyl octanoate (fruity/pineapple), ethyl acetate (pear drops), isoamyl acetate (banana), ethyl hexanoate (apple), and ethyl 9-decenoate (elderberry), among many others. Cold lager fermentations rarely produce prominent fruit-like flavors, and this is one of the major flavor differences between most ales and lager.

    <div class="carousel-caption d-none d-md-block">
    <h5> Hops</h5>
    <p>Hops are the essence of beer brewing. They are the tiny cone-shaped flowers of the Humulus lupulus plant. Hops provide both bitterness (IBUs) and a wide variety of flavor to numerous beer styles. Each variety of hop produces a different ratio of Alpha Acids, Beta Acids, and other flavor compounds that are desirable in brewing beer. Floral, Citrus, Spicy, or Fruity qualities are just some of the flavors and aromas made possible with different varieties of hops. In fact, many popular beer styles today are brewed to feature specific hop flavors. Currently, there is a wide assortment of hop varieties that provide an endless palette for experimenting with your beer brewing.

    <h5> Spices</h5>
    <p>Spices have a long history of use in beer. In fact, since the beginning of beer making some 8,000 years ago until the introduction of hops roughly in the High Middle Ages in Europe, spices both local and exotic, along with herbs, had been the dominant beer flavoring. Spices mainly used for bittering in beer and for balancing its malt aroma were bay leaf, juniper, and such seeds of the umbel family (Apiaceae) as anise, caraway, coriander, dill, and fennel. Carrot and parsley belong to this group as well. These seeds not only taste bitter but also impart significant aromas and anise/coriander/licorice flavors. Other spices add a chili-like sharpness to the brew. These include chili peppers, black and green peppers, ginger, quassia, and grains of paradise

    <h5> Malts</h5>
    <p>Malt is a terrifically important part of brewing beer. Malt adds color, flavor, and sugar content to unfermented beer. After water, it's the most common ingredient in beer. Malt is the reason that all the beer in the world is a lovely shade of gold. Malt is the reason that beer contains carbohydrates and gluten. Malt is essentially the toasted version of any cereal grain. This includes barley, wheat, oat, rye, etc.

<h1 class="text-center">ABV and IBU</h1>
<p>ABV, or alcohol by volume, is the standard measurement, used worldwide, to assess the strength of a particular beer.  The ABV scale is simple in the fact that the higher the ABV, the more alcohol that beer contains.  Lighter beers range from 4-4.5% ABV, with percentages getting higher with heavier styles of beer.<br><br>

  IBU, or international bittering unit, is a less discernable abbreviation that is as, if not more, important when it comes to selecting the type of beer that is right for you.  The IBU scale measures the bitterness levels in beer (based on the amount of hops added) and helps beer drinkers determine which styles of brews are ideal for their taste buds. Almost all the beer you're ever going to drink will have an IBU rating between 5 and 120. 5 having a very low measured bitterness and 120 having a very high measured bitterness. This scale can be tricky, however, because higher IBU levels do not always equate to bitterer flavor. </p>

<h1 class="text-center">Ale vs Lager</h1>
<p> When it comes to talking about beer, there are no two words that get thrown around as much as “ale” and “lager.” This isn’t strange, since all beer falls into at least one of these categories, but many of us have been taken down a road of miseducation when it comes to distinguishing the pair. But fear not: We’re here to help you understand the differences between the two.<br><br>

  What is a lager?
  Well, despite what lazy marketing from macro-breweries may have you believe, a lager is a broad category of many different styles. It’s okay if you never knew that. Literally billions of dollars have been spent in the process of pushing a strange mix of nonsensical buzzwords into your face that glaze over this fact. None of this is to make you feel like you need to be an expert: It’s just that understanding the distinction between ales and lagers can make it much easier to find a beer you like.<br><br>
  
  What makes a lager different from an ale?
  Yeast. Yes, it is really that simple. Ales and lagers are each made using different strains of yeast. Simply put, lagers are brewed using bottom-fermenting strains of yeast held at colder temperatures (around 40-52°F), while ales are brewed with a top fermenting yeast that operates at warmer temperatures (around 55-77°F, usually).<br><br>
  
  That’s it?!
  Of course, there’s a little more to it than that. Lager is a noun (which translates from German as “storage”), but it’s also a verb that refers to the cold storage of beer while it ferments. There’s a ton of biochemistry involved in fully understanding it, but suffice to say that lager yeast traditionally require a little more time to brew than ales.<br><br>
  
  It’s also worth noting the fascinating collision of cell biology, craftsmanship, and overall human civilization that has taken place in brewing. Specific strains have even evolved over time through brewer selection, honing the selection process even more than just picking column A or column B. So if you’re making a saison, it’s not always as easy as just hitting up Amazon for an “ale yeast.” Today, entire companies specialize in propagating entire subcategories of cells for making many specific styles.<br><br></p>
